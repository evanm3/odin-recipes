# odin-recipes

This is where I am supposed to write a brief intro describing my current project. This is supposed to be a very simple recipes websites with links to be added to later with css. The explorer bar on the right is distracting me. I am used to it having the thing that I am in highlighted rather than the tabs above. I think it's fine. These are all notes to myself. Onward.
